      <h1>Jayati Patel's Portfolio</h1>
      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p>I am a 3rd year student at Santa Clara University studying Computer Science with 
          a Data Science Emphasis. I was born in Harare, Zimbabwe and moved here to the US 
          for college. At Santa Clara University, I enjoy taking the Computer Science and Math
          classes offered, relaxing on the beautiful campus amongst the palm trees, as well as doing
          research in IoT, being a Teaching Assistant, and being a Tutor. Outside of classes, I enjoy singing
          as part of the Santa Clara University Concert Choir where I get to fully destress and have fun!
